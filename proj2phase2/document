In the prediction step, I use the interval of time between two IMU message to integrate the linear accerleration and speed to predict the next time position and speed, then I calibrate the pose estimation form the Odometry message and update the pose estimation. To make sure they two method work in the same frame, I have transformed the frame from cameraRworld to worldRimu and worldTimu. Also I make sure the first relative world frame is settled from the first odometry message.
